## WIP

**this repository is still a work in progress**

though most of the code works fine, still could be improved somewhere (such as BigInt precision and similar) and documentation will be added as soon as possible

if you want to try this package you can still install it by doing
```
npm install https://github.com/HarmonicPool/json-cbor-interop
```
